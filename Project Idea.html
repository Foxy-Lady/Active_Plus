      <h2>Posture Correction App</h2>
      <p>This idea is owned by Niroshini Tharshan.</p>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>Do you desire good posture and a healthy spine? Extended periods of looking down and working from electronic devices can result in musculoskeletal problems. 
        In our project, we are developing software that alerts users to bad postures using a secure webcam. 
        When you slouch, the application sends you notifications in red and blue to notify user to correct their posture.  </p>
      <p>Proper posture also reduces stress on your ligaments and muscles, lowering your risk of injury. 
        It also allows us to stand, walk, sit, and lie in positions that put the least strain on supporting muscles. 
        We specifically aim to provide good posture awareness to those suffering from musculoskeletal issues such as neck and back pain, injuries and strains, sprains, and strains. 
        Irrespective of whether you exercise or treat the underlying cause of your pain, it is essential that you maintain proper posture throughout your tasks. 
        We use higher skills and technology to achieve the user goals to achieve this idea. </p>

      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Posture mirroring desktop application mirrors the posture and gently sends alerts when workers hunch over and lean over desks while working. 
        The posture correction feature, which accesses individuals' cameras, does not run on the cloud, meaning no one can access data, including visuals. 
        It uses the webcam to monitor the user's posture without storing or recording any visuals. 
        So, the user needs to be comfortable with software watching through the lens while working.</p>
      <p>The application can be run non-stop, continuously monitoring posture and alerting the user of any changes in posture, or an option to do a "quick check" can be utilised to get a snapshot of how the user is sitting and give feedback on the current posture. 
        Utilising the "quick check" would be preferable for users who need more memory and CPU for their work, as running the application will use many of those resources. (Natasha Lomas 2022)  </p>
      <p>This posture-detecting application can be used with other webcam-utilising applications such as Microsoft teams or zoom. 
        This software application will run in the background concurrently whilst using other apps and display an animation of a stick figure man in the menu bar, which allows users to keep alert without being interrupted by awake messages. 
        The stick figure will either show upright and coloured blue, meaning posture is good, or the display will be that of a bent-over stick figure in red, signalling that the user must correct their posture.</p>

      <h2>Tools & Technologies</h2>
      <p>The posture correct app will primarily use Media Pipe and OpenCV on Python.  </p>
      <p>Python</p>
      <p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language and versatile tool for developing websites, software, data analysis, and Machine Learning (Python Software Foundation 2019).   
        It works on different operating systems, such as Windows, iOS, and Linux, and has a simple syntax, which allows developers to write fewer lines than other programming languages.   
        Our project is required Machine Learning with Artificial Intelligence, accessibility of webcam, stability, flexibility, and simplicity.   
        Python has large libraries, compatible with different devices and operating systems, and is easy to write and read (GeeksforGeeks 2021).  </p>
      <p>Mediapipe</p>
      <p>MediaPipe is a software library that works on Python and is similar to TensorFlow (GeeksforGeeks 2021). 
        MediaPipe supports many project ideas like hand detection, facial detention, face mesh, hair segmentation, object detection, and pose (Mediapipe). 
        It has in-depth documentation on lots of different programming languages like swift, C++, Python, and Java (GeeksforGeeks 2021).   
        It is a Machine Learning solution for high-fidelity body pose tracking, inferring 33 3D landmarks and background segmentation masks on the whole body from RGB video frames utilizing BlazePose research (Mediapipe).    </p>
      <p>OpenCV</p>
      <p>our project will use OpenCV. It is a great tool for image processing and performing computer vision tasks (OpenCV).    
        In the virtual environment, OpenCV is to get the webcam input and we will use Media Pipe’s algorithm in Python.  </p>

      <h2>Outcome</h2>
      <p>Musculoskeletal problems, muscle cramps and headaches are the most common complaints among computer workers, but there are methods for preventing them. 
        Following the guidelines of our artificial intelligence-powered Posture Mirroring software can result in significant long-term health improvements in the lives of users and consist of both physical and mental benefits.   </p>
        <li>Enhancing energy levels throughout the day.   </li>
        <li>Accelerate consumers flexibility progress.   </li>
        <li>Reduced risk of injury.   </li>
        <li>Inspection of poor body posture.   </li>
        <li>Improved mood and Sleep.   </li>
        <li>Eliminate muscle stiffness.   </li>
        <li>Healthy spine. </li>
      <p>Regularly sessions help with posture awareness and behaviour modification. 
        Alternatively, consumers will notice slouching and will naturally surrender to an upright posture and, the consumers become more aware of their muscles activity, making it easier to correct their own posture. 
        There is no need mandatory to keep it on all day. 
        Instead, using the 30-minute feature twice a day for seven days would generate outstanding results regarding improved posture knowledge and understanding and decreased Musculoskeletal problems.   </p>
