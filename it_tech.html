            <p>A cloud refers to a type of server that is located remotely (usually in data centres) and can be accessed via the internet. 
              Cloud servers can provide the same processing power, storage, and applications as traditional physical servers. 
              A cloud server is a virtual server that runs in a cloud computing environment rather than a physical server. 
              It is built, hosted, and delivered over the internet using a cloud computing platform, such as Google Docs, and can be accessed remotely. 
              They are also referred to as virtual servers. 
              Cloud servers are self-contained units that contain all of the software needed to function.  </p>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <img src="ML.png" alt="ML" style="width:100%">
            <p>In today's world, due to technological advancements, machine learning is possible because everything is online.
               This generates a vast amount of data, which is a key to the analysis. ML technology mainly uses in business for predictive analysis,
               knowledge extraction, Image recognition, behavioural analysis, and recommender systems. Furthermore, the memory handling capabilities
               of computers have increased, which helps them to process a considerable amount of data without delay. Moreover, computers have great competent powers.
               ML technology is used in many sectors such as health care, fraud detection, transportation, e-commerce, gaming, chatbots etc.  .</p>

            <h3>What is Machine Learning?</h3>
            <p>Machine learning is a part of artificial intelligence, and it uses different self-learning algorithms that derive knowledge from data to predict outcomes.
              In other words, computers can also learn from past experiences like humans. However, for computers, experiences are just data for them (Simplilearn 2022).  
              There are ways in which machines can learn.</p>
            <p>Supervised learning:  
              This is where the machine learns under guidance. It means explicitly training the machine, what is an input and what is an output.
              This is done through feeding the machine learning algorithms (Simplilearn 2022). </p>
            <p>Unsupervised learning: 
              Independently done by the machine, through learning unlabelled data.
              The trained models learn from the data, discover the patterns and features, and return the output (Simplilearn 2022). </p>
            <p>Reinforcement learning: 
              There is no pre-defined data involved. The machine learns and works based on the feedback given to the machine (Simplilearn 2022).  </p>
          </div>

          <div class="box">
            <h3>Examples of Machine Learning</h3>
            <p>Computer Vision</p>

            <p> Computer vision is part of AI and involves identifying objects in images and videos.
                  With the advancement of ML, the error rate has now lowered to just 3%. Besides the better accuracy, there would be time-saving in performing some tasks.
                  For instance, it would not be possible to classify the 100,000 pictures of dogs in a few minutes, but computer vision has great potential, and its uses in the medical field and airport security. (The 365 team. 2022)</p>

            <p>Focused Personalization  </p>
            <p>The latest ML advancement involves knowing target markets and their preferences.
              Hence, the increased accuracy of a model in businesses can measure their products and services based on exact needs using recommender systems and algorithms.  
              Ever considered how Netflix recommends the shows and Spotify plays your favourite songs?
              Machine learning is behind all these evolutions. (The 365 team. 2022) </p>

            <p>Improved Internet Search  </p>
            <p>Machine learning enhances the performance and results of the search engine by analysing past data.
              Google algorithms continue learning and getting better at returning relevant results with many google searches that have been registered.
              Google search is one of the ML development these days. (The 365 team. 2022) </p>

            <p>Chatbots   </p>
              <p>Chatbot technologies are an ongoing business trend globally, enhancing customer support and marketing. (The 365 team. 2022)  </p>
            
            <p>Transportation System </p> 
            <p>Over recent years, we have all experienced and been amazed by the developments in the transportation system. All these are possible through machine learning technology. 
              This technique explores the crashes, traffic, environmental aspects, intricate relations of road, and so on. (The 365 team. 2022)  
              Moreover, many aviation and logistic companies are adopting this tech to increase efficiency, safety, and accuracy of arrival time. </p>

            <h3>What is the likely impact? </h3>
            <p>Machine learning is transforming the world in many fields, including healthcare services, agriculture, education, transport, food, banks, entertainment, etc. 
              Technologies like IoT and cloud computing are all growing implementations of ML. ML offers potential value to companies trying to leverage big data for customer satisfaction. 
              Although ML technology has impacted the workforce is impressive. There would be expecting changes in some fields, such as:  </p>

            <p>Health care:</p> 
            <p>It simplifies administrative methodologies in hospitals and medical treatments and treats infectious diseases. It can affect hospitals and health systems in enhancing efficiency while lowering the value of care. 
              This technology in the medical field will not wholly substitute humans.   </p>
              
            <p>Agriculture:</p> 
            <p>ML technology assures that the crop is top-quality and takes less time. The ML algorithms check soil conditions and predict the quality of products. It can cut labour by doing all the fieldwork itself.  </p>  
               
            <p>Robotics:</p> 
            <p>A machine learning algorithm is used in designing the software of the robots. 
              Using AI in hospitals, Age care, Military, hotels, restaurants, airports, and retail for customer interaction can cut the labour force of humans.   </p>
            
            <p>Automotive Industry:</p>
            <p>The car manufacturers are working on creating the fully autonomous vehicle. Machine learning is one of the leading technologies that can help to turn this innovation into reality.  </p>
              
            <p>Manufacturing sector:</p> 
            <p>Adopting ML technology for business operations can reduce costs, improve quality control, and enhance supply chain management. The future of employment will be at risk as ML can do more complex tasks efficiently than humans. All the jobs will be taken by the algorithm and replaced with machines and automation software. With this technology, some industries have already started reducing human intervention. However, in the next few years, some jobs will disappear, such as drivers, customer service jobs, cashiers, accountants, bookkeepers, bank tellers, financial advisers, farmers, manufacturing workers, dispatchers, servers, construction workers, movie stars and more. 
              Instead of eliminating the need for human labour, ML disruptions will redirect job demand. However, people will have to retrain and learn new skills in their jobs. </p>

            <h3>What does it do?</h3>
            <img src="car.png" alt="" style="width:100%">
            <p>An autonomous vehicle is a vehicle that does not need any external input from a user in order to carry out its normal duties. 
              Now there aren’t just autonomous and non-autonomous vehicle, there are six level of automation existing today. 
              Level 0 – 2 primarily controlled by a human user whereas
              3 – 5 is controlled by the system put in place. (Synopsys 2022) elaborates on the six levels of autonomy.  </p>
          </div>
          <div class="box">
            <h3>6 levels of autonomy</h3>  
            <img src="6levels.png" alt="" style="width:100%"> 
              <ul> 0 Complete manual control of the vehicle with minor features  </ul>
                <ul> 1 Driver assistance providing braking, acceleration OR steering support  </ul>
                <ul>2 Partial Automation which has both steering AND brakes / acceleration  </ul>
                <ul> 3 Conditional automation, vehicle can detect environment, requires conditions to be driver-less, human input still required  </ul>
                <ul>4 High automation, all driving tasks are performed by the vehicle under specific circumstances. Interaction from the human is optional.  </ul>
                <ul>5 Full automation, the vehicle performs all driving tasks, no human intervention is required.  </ul>
          </div> 
          <div class="box">
            <h3>When will we have Full autonomy?  </h3>
            <p>At this stage, vehicles are at level 2 autonomy, meaning that the human is still primarily in control. The main reason for this is the security risk, that being a cybersecurity risk. 
              For an autonomous vehicle to seamlessly integrate into society, it will need to be able to communicate with other systems in the environment.  </p>
